\usage{
calcWPM(normal_db, vec_weights)
}
\arguments{
\item{normal_db}{A data set object with normalized values of
Alternatives X Criteria}

\item{vec_weights}{Contains a set of user assigned values to weight
the criteria.
The sum of these weights must add up to 1.
The format of this input is an array of values.}
}
\value{
A data frame object that contains 2 columns and the the same number
of rows as the input matrix. The columns "WPM_Rank" has the calculated
relative value of each alternative whose id is in the "Alternative" column
}
\description{
Calculates the ranking for the alternative's set according to
WPM method
}
